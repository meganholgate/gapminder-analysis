these will be how headers turn up in the table of contents. If not in order Markdwon gets confused. Also decides the size

- first item in the list

# Background to Gapminder
 
Gapminder is an independent Swedish foundation with no *political, religious or economic affiliations*. Gapminder is a **fact tank**, not a think tank. Gapminder fights devastating misconceptions about global development. Gapminder produces *free teaching resources* making the world understandable based on reliable statistics. Gapminder promotes a fact-based worldview everyone can understand.  Gapminder collaborates with universities, UN, public agencies and non-governmental organizations. All Gapminder activities are governed by the board. We do not award grants. Gapminder Foundation is registered at Stockholm County Administration Board
 
 For keyboard short cut help in R go to Tools - keyboard shortcuts
 To insert chunks of R code go to insert at the top and click R. On a mac can use ctrl option I
```{r}
a <- 10
b <- 15
a*b
```


chunk uses
There are a lot of things you can do in a code chunk:
you can produce text output, tables, or graphics.
You have fine control over all these output via chunk options, which can be provided inside the curly braces  
For example, you can choose hide text output via the chunk option results = 'hide', or set the figure height to 4 inches via fig.height = 4.
Each chunk needs a seperate name if you do name it
Look at cheat sheet for chunk control options
Chunk options are separated by commas, e.g.,
```{r, chunk-label, results='hide', fig.height=4}```
 
eval= false at end of code means that the output of the code chunk won't be included
see website for more options


can use set up chunk to set settings for the whole document (opts_chunk)

# Installation instructions

So to run this we need to install a few packages:

1. ggplot2
2. skimr
3. DT

To instal these we use

```{r, packages needed, eval=FALSE}
install.packages(c("skimr", "ggplot2", "DT"))
```

# Displaying data

Data can be read in ro Markdown in different ways
you can print data.frames

```{R} 
data(airquality)
head(airquality)
```

You can use tibble instead of data and it looks nicer to the reader
tibble is from tidyverse so new R. Tibble is a posh data frame that prints nicely
Only prints the top 10 but tells you more info on the data not shown

```{R}
library(tibble)
as_tibble(airquality)
```


## Displaying knitr::kable() tables
We can use other packages to create html tables from our data.
The simplest is to use the knitr::kable() function.
This uses kable on just the head of airquality. This makes a proper html table

```{R}
library(knitr)
data(airquality)
kable(head(airquality), caption = "New York Air Quality Measurements")
```


## Interactive table
Displaying interactive DT::datatable() tables
You can display interactive html tables using function DT::datatable():

```{R}
library(DT)
data(airquality)
datatable(airquality, caption = "New York Air Quality Measurements")
```

This is really useful for sending to collaborators etc
Allows all the data to be present in a useful way


##Summarising data with skimr::skim()
Fuction skimr::skim() provides a simple approach to displaying summary statistics that can be quickly skimmed quickly to understand data.
```{R}
skimr::skim(airquality)
```


# Plots

By default, figures produced by R code will be placed immediately after the code chunk they were generated from.
Letâ€™s use ggplot2 to have a look to the relationship between a couple of variables

```{R, yet another chunk, echo= FALSE, warning= FALSE, error= FALSE, message= FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library("gapminder", lib.loc="~/R/win-library/3.5")

p <- ggplot(gapminder, aes(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent)) + 
  geom_point()
p
library(plotly)

ggplotly(p)
```

## interactive plots with plotly
Wraps nicely around plotting library ggplot2
